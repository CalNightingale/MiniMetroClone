Click and drag from a station to create a subway line. </p> <h2>Project Info and Background</h2> <p> I started this project mainly to learn more about web app development and Typescript. I really enjoyed the namesake game, <a href="https://dinopoloclub.com/games/mini-metro/">Mini Metro</a>, and decided to try to remake it to gain some valuable experience. I'm pretty happy with how this turned out, although there are some definite areas I would like to improve. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/CalNightingale/SmallSubway/issues">issues page</a> on the game's <a href="https://github.com/CalNightingale/SmallSubway">Github repo</a> if you're curious about the next steps! </p> </div> </body></html>
